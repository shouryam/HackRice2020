                        Clear patterns of healthcare inequity exist along racial lines. However, the severity of
                        these trends may be hard to put into perspective. The mission of this website is to provide
                        all individuals with quantitative information to better understand the breadth and
                        depth of this healthcare inequity crisis. When more individuals become aware of how race
                        affects healthcare outcomes, we can add urgency to the movement for greater equality.
